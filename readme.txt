WizardTD v0.1 (Prototype)

A limited tower defence game where enemies are spawned in 5 increasingly more difficult waves.
Enemies make their way (from multiple directions) towards your central fortress.
Towers that shoot and destroy enemies can be placed on plots, and can also be upgraded and destroyed.
